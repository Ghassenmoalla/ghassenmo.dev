Dependency-Track is an intelligent component analysis platform that helps DevOps teams reduce risks in the software supply chain.

With modern applications relying heavily on open-source components, securing dependencies is critical. Dependency-Track:

- Continuously monitors SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials)
- Detects vulnerabilities before they reach production
- Automates policy enforcement across teams

In this guide, I’ll show you how to deploy Dependency-Track securely on Azure using private endpoints and Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication.

## Use Case

We want a secure and scalable solution where:

- Only internal users can access Dependency-Track.
- All traffic stays within private endpoints in the Azure virtual network (VNet).
- Azure AD provides identity and access management.

## Architecture & Azure Components Overview

High-level flow:

Frontend → Azure Static Web App

API → Azure App Service (Docker container)

Database → Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server

Networking → Private Endpoints for all components

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with admin permissions
- Access to Azure Active Directory for app registration
- A DNS zone (e.g., example.com)
- An existing virtual network (VNet)

## Step-by-step deployment (overview)

### 1) Configure Azure AD for OIDC

- Register an app in Azure AD for Dependency-Track
- Enable ID tokens (Implicit Grant) if needed
- Add required API permissions (openid, profile, email)
- Configure redirect URIs used by the frontend

### 2) Networking

- Create subnets for private endpoints (e.g., `snet-deptrack`)
- Create delegated subnet for App Service (e.g., `snet-deptrack-del`)
- Configure Private DNS zones and mappings for each service

### 3) Frontend

- Deploy the frontend to Azure Static Web Apps
- Secure with a Private Endpoint and configure private DNS

### 4) API

- Deploy API as an App Service (Docker) with VNet integration
- Use private endpoints to keep traffic internal
- Set environment variables for DB connections and OIDC settings

### 5) PostgreSQL

- Deploy Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
- Restrict public access and secure it with Private Endpoints

### 6) OIDC & Login

- Configure the frontend to use Azure AD for authentication
- Map Azure AD groups to Dependency-Track teams for authorization

## Notes & Tips

- Use managed identities where possible to avoid embedding credentials.
- Use Azure Key Vault to store secrets and connection strings.
- Monitor resources and set up alerts for critical events.

## Conclusion

You’ve successfully deployed Dependency-Track on Azure with private endpoints and Azure AD authentication. This architecture keeps the system isolated from the public internet while allowing secure access to authorized users.

If you want, I can expand this guide with ARM/Bicep or Terraform examples, CI/CD pipeline configs for deployment, and step-by-step CLI commands.
